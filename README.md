# BuildPong
A simple Pong game built using Python and Turtle Graphics. This project is a remake of the classic arcade game where two players control paddles to keep the ball in play.
 Programming Concepts Applied
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Classes like Paddle, Ball, and Scoreboard manage different game elements
 Collision Detection & Physics – The ball reacts to walls and paddles realistically
 Event Handling & Keyboard Controls – screen.onkey() captures player input
 Game Loop – The game runs inside a continuous while loop for real-time updates
